# WebSay
Say words on the web with [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) (with a lot of help from [meSpeak](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/))

**Requirements:** `node.js`, `npm`

#About
**eSpeak** is an open-source speech synthesizer.
> Originally known as speak and originally written for Acorn/RISC_OS computers starting in 1995. This version is an enhancement and re-write, including a relaxation of the original memory and processing power constraints, and with support for additional languages. 

**meSpeak** is based on a port of eSpeak for JavaScript.

**WebSay** uses these resources to bring easy TTS to the web. :^)

### To-do
* Downloadable .wavs
* More voices _(Unfortunately, MacinTalk and DECTalk ("Klatt") are proprietary.)_
* Rad UI
